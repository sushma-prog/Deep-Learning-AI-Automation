# 🚀 Day 6: AI-Powered Coding with Free & Open Models

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my **Day 6 learning path**, where I explored how to use **free Hugging Face models** for coding tasks.
The goal was to understand how AI can **generate Python code, summarize outputs, and create docstrings/tests** — without needing paid APIs.

By the end of this day, I built a **mini coding assistant notebook** (`AI_Powered_Coding.ipynb`) that works like a lightweight version of GitHub Copilot, but runs **locally or in Colab for free**.

## 🔹 Key Learnings & Steps

### 1. Exploring Hugging Face Models

* Hugging Face hosts thousands of **open-source AI models**.
* Popular coding models include:

  * `deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct`
  * `codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct`
  * `bigcode/starcoder`

---

### 2. Setup

Installed the required libraries (`transformers`, `accelerate`, etc.) and learned that **no API keys** are needed when running locally/Colab.

---

### 3. Auto-Generating Code

* Gave prompts like *“Load Titanic dataset and show summary stats.”*
* The model generated **ready-to-run Python code** directly.

---

### 4. Summarizing Outputs

* Passed results (like a confusion matrix) back to the model.
* Got **simple, beginner-friendly explanations**.

---

### 5. Writing Docstrings & Tests

* Learned how AI can auto-generate **Google-style docstrings** and **pytest unit tests** for functions.

---

### 6. Building the Coding Assistant inside same Notebook

Created **`AI_Powered_Coding.ipynb`** where:

1. User enters a coding request.
2. Model generates Python code.
3. Code is executed in the next cell.
4. Model generates explanations, docstrings, and tests.

## 🌟 Outcomes

* ✅ Learned to use Hugging Face models for **free AI coding**
* ✅ Generated working Python code from prompts
* ✅ Summarized outputs like confusion matrices
* ✅ Created docstrings & tests automatically
* ✅ Built a **mini Copilot-style assistant notebook**

---

## 📢 Credits

* Built by **Sushma Sandanshiv** as part of her **Day 6 AI learning journey**
* Powered by:

  * [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models)
  * `transformers` library

✨ This project shows how **AI can assist in writing, testing, and explaining code** — making coding faster, easier, and more beginner-friendly.
