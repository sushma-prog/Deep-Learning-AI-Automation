            "\n",
            "This project leverages the power of **Linear Regression** to develop a predictive model for house prices. The goal is to build a robust model that can estimate the value of a house based on various input features.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 2. Project Objectives\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Accurate Prediction:** To accurately predict house prices based on a given set of features.\n",
            "*   **Model Understanding:** To build a clear and interpretable model using Linear Regression.\n",
            "*   **Decision Support:** To provide a foundational tool for real estate analysis, assisting potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3. Methodology: Linear Regression\n",
            "\n",
            "This project employs **Linear Regression**, a fundamental statistical model used to predict a continuous target variable (house price) based on one or more predictor variables (features).\n",
            "\n",
            "### How it Works:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Linear Relationship:** Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the house price.\n",
            "*   **Best Fit Line:** The model finds the \"best-fit\" line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed prices and the prices predicted by the model.\n",
            "*   **Coefficients:** It determines coefficients for each feature, indicating how much the house price is expected to change for a one-unit change in that feature, holding other features constant.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Project Steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering a dataset containing various house features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location, year built) and their corresponding prices.\n",
            "2.  **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
            "    *   Cleaning missing values.\n",
            "    *   Handling categorical variables (e.g., using one-hot encoding).\n",
            "    *   Scaling numerical features if necessary.\n",
            "3.  **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
            "4.  **Model Training:** Training the Linear Regression model on the training data.\n",
            "5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.\n",
            "6.  **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict prices for new, unseen house data.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 4. Key Features\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Handles loading data from a specified source and preparing it for model training.\n",

            "*   **Model Evaluation:** Calculates and reports key performance metrics to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.\n",

            "3.  **Backward Propagation (Playing the Blame Game & Fixing It):**\n",

            "    *   **Distribute Blame Backward:** Now, this last machine looks back at the machine *before* it and asks, \"How much did *your* settings contribute to *my* error?\" It calculates how much \"blame\" to pass to the previous machine.\n",

If it was contributing to the product being too short, it adjusts to make it longer. If it made it too red, it adjusts to make it less red.\n",
